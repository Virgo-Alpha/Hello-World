            In a few seconds I’ll tell you a tale

            As time flies by it won’t remain stale
            
            There once was a person who broke alot
            
            He had a few pieces but nothing he got
            </div>
            He tried some fixes but all in vain
            
            The wind flew by and his pieces were slain
            
            He met some people along the way
            
            The tides were turning for a better day
            
            He thought his puzzle was ready to go
            
            But little did he know it was all a show
            
            Filled with rage, anger and madness
            
            He broke his castle full of sadness
            
            He felt broken depressed and lost
            
            The abyss only held darkness and frost
            
            For him the world was colder than ice
            
            But his fire inside was ready to ignite
            
            With a burning desire he stood once more
            
            Met a few more people down the road
            
            Heart was filled with happiness and joy
            
            Faced everything with the fervor of a boy
            
            The flow of time again hit the shore
            
            The faces he knew were not there anymore
            
            But this time he didn’t feel down
            
            He rebuild his castle and put on his crown.

        <h5>Annabel Lee</h5>
        <em>BY EDGAR ALLAN POE</em>
        It was many and many a year ago,
           In a kingdom by the sea,
        That a maiden there lived whom you may know
           By the name of Annabel Lee;
        And this maiden she lived with no other thought
           Than to love and be loved by me.
        
        I was a child and she was a child,
           In this kingdom by the sea,
        But we loved with a love that was more than love—
           I and my Annabel Lee—
        With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
           Coveted her and me.
        
        And this was the reason that, long ago,
           In this kingdom by the sea,
        A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
           My beautiful Annabel Lee;
        So that her highborn kinsmen came
           And bore her away from me,
        To shut her up in a sepulchre
           In this kingdom by the sea.
        
        The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
           Went envying her and me—
        Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
           In this kingdom by the sea)
        That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
           Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
        
        But our love it was stronger by far than the love
           Of those who were older than we—
           Of many far wiser than we—
        And neither the angels in Heaven above
           Nor the demons down under the sea
        Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
           Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
        
        For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
           Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
        And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
           Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
        And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
           Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
           In her sepulchre there by the sea—
           In her tomb by the sounding sea.

    <h4 id="link3">Desiderata</h4>
        <pre style="font-size:150%">
            Go placidly amid <span id="link5"> noise and the haste</span>, 
            and remember what peace there may be in silence.
            As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. 
            Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, 
            even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
            Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.
            If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, 
            for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
            Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. 
            Keep interested in your own career, however humble; 
            it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. 
            Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. 
            But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
            many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. 
            Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. 
            Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.
            Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. 
            Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. 
            But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. 
            Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. 
            You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. 
            And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. 
            Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. 
            And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.
            With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. 
            Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.[3]

        <p class="Personal info"><b>The Road Not Taken</b>
            <pre style="text-align: center;">
                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                And sorry I could not travel both
                And be one traveler, long I stood
                And looked down one as far as I could
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                
                Then took the other, just as fair,
                And having perhaps the better claim,
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                Though as for that the passing there
                Had worn them really about the same,
                
                And both that morning equally lay
                In leaves, no step had trodden black.
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                I doubted if I should ever come back.
                
                I shall be telling this with a sigh
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
                I took the one less traveled by,
                And that has made all the difference.
